# Angular QuickStart Javascript Source

This repository holds the Javascript source code of the [ngxjs.io quickstart](http://www.ngxjs.io/blog/quickstart),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular**

We are unlikely to accept suggestions about how to grow this QuickStart into something it is not.
Please keep that in mind before posting issues and PRs.

## Updating to a newer version of the Quickstart Repo

From time to time the QuickStart will add be enhanced with support for new features or to reflect changes

You can update your existing project to an up-to-date QuickStart by following these instructions:
- Create a new project using the [instructions below](#create-a-new-project-based-on-the-quickstart)
- Copy the code you have in your project's `main.js` file onto `src/app/main.js` in the new project
- Copy your old `app` folder into `src/app`
- Copy your old `index.html` into `src/`
- Copy your old `styles.css` into `src/styles/app.css`
- Install all your third party dependencies
- Copy over any other files you added to your project
- Copy your old `.git` folder into your new project's root

Now you can continue working on the new project.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-project`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart  my-project
cd my-project
```

We have no intention of updating the source on `angular/quickstart`.
Discard the `.git` folder..
```shell
rm -rf .git  # OS/X (bash)
rd .git /S/Q # windows
```

### Create a new git repo
You could [start writing code](#start-development) now and throw it all away when you're done.
If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Initialize this project as a *local git repo* and make the first commit:
```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a *remote repository* for this project on the service of your choice.

Grab its address (e.g. *`https://github.com/<my-org>/my-project.git`*) and push the *local repo* to the *remote*.
```shell
git remote add origin <repo-address>
git push -u origin master
```
## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

>Doesn't work in _Bash for Windows_ which does not support servers as of January, 2017.

The `npm start` command first compiles the application,
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the webpack build for production.
